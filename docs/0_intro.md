# What's Runme?

- Converts markdown files to interactive notebooks
- Understands shell environments and the cloud
- Runs multiple languages (Python, Bash, SQL, etc.)
- Universal task runner with editor, terminal, and notebook support

Borrows from Jupyter but accounts for developers and operators splitting time between the terminal, editor, browser tabs, and the cloud.

## It's just Markdown üí°

- Runme parsers and saved markdown files
- One person, everyone, or a few team members can use Runme
- Won't lock out anybody else

## Runs anywhere üåç

Just like Chromium is powering Brave, Chrome, and Edge, Runme is built on the VS Code Platform (OSS). You don't have to use Microsoft's VS Code.

Pick your favorite flavor üç¶:

```ruby {"id":"01J9QNCBKDPS7670F73ZD46KVK","interactive":"true","terminalRows":"10"}
editors = ["VSCodium, Eclipse Theia", "WSL on Windows", "GitHub Codespaces", "Coder's code-server", "Google IDX, GCP Cloud Editor", "Gitpod", "The newly hyped AI-first Cursor"]

puts "\e[1mJust grab Runme from Open-VSX.org and you're good to go:\n\e[0m"

editors.each_with_index do |editor, index|
    offset = 31+index
    puts "\e[#{offset}m- #{editor}\e[0m"
    sleep 0.5
end
```

## Keep docs generic

Don't clutter your runnable docs with shell-scripting. Instead, we can configure the docs behavior at multiple levels:

1. Document-level Annotations in the Frontmatter
2. Block/Cell-level Annotations inside the Fenced Code Block
3. Specific VS Code settings
4. Repo/project config, aka `.runme.yaml` (coming soon)

![Configure](https://docs.runme.dev/assets/images/backgroundrunme1-de927356e3e68604d253ca4ef57da364.png)

## Environment variables & prompts

Runme detects top-level variable exports, e.g., `export MY_NAME=Enter your name`, and resolved them automatically if possible.

```sh {"id":"01J9PY2CP9YAAKAN4F3N48Z8T8","promptEnv":"yes"}
export MY_NAME="Max Mustermann"
```

- Runme maintains a managed env store per session
- It plays nicely with `.env` and friends to pre-load env vars
- Exported variables that remain valueless are prompted for user input

## Example of valueless export `MY_NAME`

```sh {"id":"01J9PX7MNWM2TFTHBHRA6RAN72","name":"my-name","promptEnv":"auto"}
echo "My name is ${MY_NAME}."
```

Unless resolved otherwise configured Runme will prompt for user input.

## Configure cell's prompt behavior

Easily change the mode using the `Configure` button in cell's bottom right. Values without quotes the value will become a prompt message.

```sh {"id":"01J9PYB8XKZKYKJFRVVPWY0HTJ","promptEnv":"auto"}
export MY_NAME=Enter your name here
```

At times, it makes to provide placeholder values and merely prompt for confirmation. Just wrap the prompt message in quotes.

```sh {"id":"01J9PYY3T6EM7YYWGKWTR8JE4G","promptEnv":"yes"}
export MY_NAME="Luna üêï, my dog"
```

## Giving cells names

You can add well-known names to cells.

```sh {"id":"01J9PZT9EY6H3DS05KCQFHBE1B","name":"CONFIG_PATH"}
echo "${HOME}/.config/testing"
```

This is useful for:

- Easily exposing cells as tasks in the CLI
- Stash a cell's output in the ENV for later use
- Referencing cells from other cells

```sh {"id":"01J9PZS6SD8DNZTSKVY4BQVY83","name":"setup","terminalRows":"10"}
npm install
```

The output of the last recent run cell is always available as `$__`.

```sh {"id":"01J9Q00CMHKZ5V0F94R87YC1BX"}
echo -n $__
```

## Automatic media type detection

Non-text outputs are automatically detected and rendered as media if `interactive` mode is disabled.

```sql {"id":"01J9Q0SWVP2TXP6MT5MXWYRK2H","name":"QUERY"}
SELECT title, num_characters, timestamp, id, revision_id FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.samples.wikipedia`
WHERE num_characters < 67100
LIMIT 12;
```

```sh {"id":"01J9Q0TBXDFNMWWPDYPYY66FR3","interactive":"false"}
$ bq query --format json --use_legacy_sql=false $QUERY 2> /dev/null | jq .
```

## Into the Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è

Now that we explored the basics, let's see how Runme can help us in [the cloud‚Ñ¢Ô∏è](1_aws.md).
